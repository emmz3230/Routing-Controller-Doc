| Signature                          | Example                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| @Controller(baseRoute: string)     | @Controller("/users") class SomeController         | Class that is marked with this decorator is registered as controller and its annotated methods are registered as actions. Base route is used to concatenate it to all controller action routes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| @JsonController(baseRoute: string) | @JsonController("/users") class SomeJsonController | Class that is marked with this decorator is registered as controller and its annotated methods are registered as actions. Difference between @JsonController and @Controller is that @JsonController automatically converts results returned by controller to json objects (using JSON.parse) and response being sent to a client is sent with application/json content-type. Base route is used to concatenate it to all controller action routes. |
